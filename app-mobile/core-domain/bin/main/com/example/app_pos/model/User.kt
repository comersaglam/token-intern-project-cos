/**
 * An app-mobile ACCOUNT — a real person who signed in with their phone + OTP.
 *
 * This is NOT the same thing as [Customer]:
 *  - [Customer] is a MERCHANT'S LEDGER ENTRY (what app-pos knows). It can be
 *    UNCLAIMED — just a name + phone the merchant typed, with no account behind it.
 *  - [User] is an actual account. One account, two possible roles held as separate
 *    boolean flags: everyone starts a buyer; the "Become a seller" button flips
 *    isSeller on. Both roles can be active at once (a shopkeeper who also shops).
 *
 * The bridge between them is CLAIM: when a User signs in with a phone number that
 * matches an UNCLAIMED Customer, that customer record becomes CLAIMED and points
 * back to this User via Customer.claimedByUserId (the old debt is inherited).
