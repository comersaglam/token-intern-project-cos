/**
 * What the composing repository needs from on-device storage.
 *
 * It is the full [Repository] surface plus [observeAllUsers]. The extra method exists
 * because OfflineFirstRepository resolves "who is signed in" from the PERSISTED session
 * rather than from the local source's own RAM mock, so it needs the user table unfiltered.
 *
 * Kept as an interface for one concrete reason: it makes the session logic testable without
 * Room. A JVM unit test can supply a trivial implementation and assert on the gate — the
 * thing this phase actually changes — instead of standing up a database to reach it.
