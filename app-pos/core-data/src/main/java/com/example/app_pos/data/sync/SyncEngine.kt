/**
 * Drains the offline outbox: takes the writes Room already accepted and pushes them to the
 * server, one at a time, oldest first.
 *
 * This is where the network finally enters app-pos's write path — and note where it does
 * NOT: booking a veresiye still only touches Room, so the shopkeeper is never blocked by
 * signal. Sending is a separate, later, retryable act.
 *
 * Three rules do the real work:
 *
 *  1. **Order.** Oldest first, and a retryable failure STOPS the run. If the network is
 *     down, entry two will fail for the same reason entry one did; hammering the rest only
 *     inflates every retryCount and burns battery.
 *  2. **What to do with a failure** comes from [isRetryable], defined once on ApiResult:
 *     a lost connection or a 5xx keeps the row, a 4xx removes it. Retrying a request the
 *     server has permanently refused would loop forever; dropping one it merely could not
 *     answer would lose a veresiye.
 *  3. **Deleting is safe because the send is idempotent.** The Idempotency-Key is the
 *     entry's own transaction id, so if the response was lost after the server committed,
 *     the resend replays the original write rather than booking a second one.
