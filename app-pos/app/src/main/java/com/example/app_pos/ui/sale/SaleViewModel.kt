 *
 * Scoped to the saleFlow nested graph (see nav_graph.xml), so all fragments in
 * the flow read and write the same instance, and leaving the flow destroys it —
 * the next sale starts clean without any manual reset.
 *
 * One flow serves both transaction types (txType): a DEBT started from the
 * payment app (amount handed over via Intent) and a PAYMENT started from a
 * customer's detail screen (amount keyed in on the in-app keypad). Both share the
 * same confirm → OTP → write pipeline.
 *
 * The amount lives in minor units (kuruş) as a Long, exactly like the ledger
 * stores it, so no floating point or string parsing is ever involved.
